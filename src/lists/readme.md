# LIBRARY DETAILS

A collection of functions for dealing with publishing pages in Sharepoint. To be documented...


## NOTES
- Sometimes you need to access the values thru the FieldValues property, others you should use the ID value ( lookup column case ). 
- Because of this reason, it is recommended that you first peek in the list item structure using the getlistItems function.
